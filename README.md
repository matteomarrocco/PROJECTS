## Knowledge Graph Construction for Football Performance Analysis

This project focuses on applying **Knowledge Graph** (KG) technology to football performance analysis. The main objective was to develop a knowledge graph that captures relationships between **teams**, **matches**, **players**, and their **performance metrics**. The knowledge graph provides a structured framework to uncover detailed insights into player and team performance, offering actionable data for tactical analysis and strategic decisions.

### Key Contributions:
- **Data Collection & Verification**: Collected comprehensive datasets for the 2022/2023 season from multiple sources, including match outcomes from *Football Data.co.uk* and player statistics from *FBref.com*. The data was cleaned and verified to ensure accuracy, with a focus on removing inconsistencies and addressing missing values.
  
- **Building the Knowledge Graph**: Developed a robust KG by defining **classes** and **relationships** between football entities, such as players, teams, and matches. The data was converted into RDF format and structured into a graph with entities represented as nodes and relationships as edges. 

- **Data Quality Checks**: Performed rigorous checks to ensure data quality, focusing on the consistency and completeness of match and player data. SPARQL queries were employed to identify and resolve inconsistencies, such as negative values and missing player data.

- **Data Analysis**: Utilized the knowledge graph to analyze player and team performance. Key insights include identifying top-performing players based on metrics such as goals, assists, and match participation. A particular focus was placed on assessing player contributions within their teams and identifying emerging talent.

- **Visualizations**: Created visualizations to showcase player contributions and identify key performers in matches. For example, a histogram was generated to highlight significant players in high-stakes matches, and pie charts were used to represent the contribution of top players to team performance.

- **Talent Scouting**: Used the knowledge graph to highlight emerging young talents by filtering players based on age and their contribution to goals and assists. This proactive approach aims to identify high-potential players before they gain widespread recognition.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data collection, processing, and analysis.
- **SPARQL**: Query language used to interact with the knowledge graph and extract meaningful insights.
- **NetworkX**: For graph construction and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

### Challenges & Lessons Learned:
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Data from different leagues and sources had varying structures, requiring significant effort to standardize and clean the datasets.
- **Missing Data**: Some player statistics had missing values, which were handled by filling in missing data with zeros to maintain dataset integrity.
- **Algorithm Refinement**: Refining the algorithms to extract meaningful patterns from the knowledge graph was an ongoing process. Future work will focus on improving data accuracy and incorporating more complex performance metrics.

This project demonstrates the power of **data-driven football analytics** and highlights the potential of knowledge graph technology in sports analysis. By utilizing structured data, this approach offers deeper insights into player performance, team dynamics, and emerging trends, providing valuable tools for coaches, analysts, and decision-makers in the football world.
